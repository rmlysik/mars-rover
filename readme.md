# Introduction

Mars Rover is a game that I developed using HTML, CSS and JavaScript to help illustrate simple programming concepts for a career day presentation. The player must write a program that instructs the Rover to navigate from the starting position to a target destination. 

# Playing the Game

To successfully navigate the Rover from the lower left square of the screen to the upper right corner of the screen write a program using the following simple commands:

- Turn the Rover 90 degrees to the right.
- Turn the Rover 90 degrees to the left.
- Move one square in the direction that the Rover is currently facing.

Enter the program into the text window on the right of the screen using only the R, L, or M commands, e.g. "MMML" will move the rover three squares and then turn the Rover 90 degrees to the right. When you're confident that you have the program ready, test it by clicking the "Transmit" button. If the Rover reaches the target destination, the message "Mission Success" will be displayed, otherwise "Mission Failure" will appear. Click "Reset" to clear the program window and reset the Rover's position so that you can try again.
